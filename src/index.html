    <h1>hey i'm jasper ðŸ¦Ž</h1>
    <h2 class="margin-bottom-2rem">and this is my personal site or whatever i guess</h2>
    <p>there's not really anything to see here yet so for now you can go look at my <a
        href="https://entropically.neocities.org/">headmate's website</a> ig</p>
    <details>
      <summary>or read more about me???</summary>
      <p>i'm agender and my pronouns are ze/zir (they/them is also acceptable). i like reptiles, blood, horror, pretty
        anime boys, and being cringe. a famous(?) thing i said once was "basically just think of the phrase 'evil twink'
        and whatever you just pictured. thats me". uh, i tend to be pretty crass and maybe have a dark sense of humor or
        smth?</p>
      <p>i'm plural (learn about
        plurality with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M34kR9JWWqc" rel="noopener noreferrer">video from
          body et al</a> or at <a href="https://dragonsroost.neocities.org/pluralstuff"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">dragon's roost</a>) and actually i hardly ever front lol, i spend most of my time
        dormant or in headspace..
        but like.... despite that, i think it would be nice to have my own little slice of "real world" here, even if
        it's just on the internet??? and it would be cool to be able to meet people like genuinely as myself and not
        just as part of vance, so... yeah</p>
      <p>you can read more about our collective on <a href="https://entropically.neocities.org/aboutme#jasper">vance's
          about page</a></p>
      <p>...like i might use this page to talk more about Plural Stuff TM but also i kinda don't fucking want to because
        i'm sick of all of "my things" inevitably just consisting of talking about the experience of being plural.....
        like nah i just wanna talk about lizerds or smth ?? ?</p>

    <p>you can contact me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gurolizard" rel="me">mastodon</a> or <a
        href="https://twitter.com/gurolizard" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter</a>--note that my twitter is 18+,
      though, and my mastodon has <em>occassional</em> nsfw posts that are hidden behind warnings. (this website will probably also be 18+ once it actually has content lol)</p>
