    <h1>hey i'm jasper ðŸ¦Ž</h1>
    <h2>and this is my personal site or whatever i guess</h2>
    <p>there's not really anything to see here yet so for now you can go look at my <a href="https://entropically.neocities.org/">headmate's website</a> ig</p>
    <details>
      <summary>or read more about me???</summary>
      <p>i'm agender and my pronouns are ze/zir (they/them is also acceptable). i like reptiles, blood, horror, pretty anime boys, and being cringe. a famous(?) thing i said once was "basically just think of the phrase 'evil twink' and whatever you just pictured. thats me". uh, i tend to be pretty crass and maybe have a dark sense of humor or smth?</p>
      <p>i'm plural (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M34kR9JWWqc" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn about plurality here</a>) and actually i hardly ever front lol, i spend most of my time dormant or in headspace.. but like.... despite that, i think it would be nice to have my own little slice of "real world" here, even if it's just on the internet??? and it would be cool to be able to meet people like genuinely as myself and not just as part of vance, so... yeah</p>
      <p>you can read more about our collective on <a href="https://entropically.neocities.org/aboutme#jasper">vance's about page</a></p>
